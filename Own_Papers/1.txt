Supa can be tens of meters deep and very wide. The deepest measured
suppa in Finland is located in Janakkala, Kalpalinna, where the height
difference between Inkolinna and the adjacent Supa is 74 meters. Supa's
theoretical maximum depth in Finland is 80 meters. It is due to the depth
of the ancient sea level and the length of the cracks in the edge of the
glacier. Valkeakoski's Säaksmäki Linnavuori soup is just like this. The
bottom of the sumpa can be deeper than the surface of the groundwater,
so groundwater can seep through the bottom into the sumpa. Suppa lakes
like this are located next to or in the middle of many ridge sections
or ridge areas. Proximity to groundwater can also cause swamping of the
bottom area.

Supa's microclimate is interesting, as the temperature drops even several
degrees as you go to the bottom of Supa, because cooler air flows to
its bottom. The phenomenon can be observed, for example, in spring:
when other areas have already been cleared of snow, there may still be
snow and ice at the bottom of Supa. The decrease in temperature is also
reflected in the vegetation of the Supa slope, where heat-demanding
plants appear on the upper slopes but are absent at the bottom of Supa.
